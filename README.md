20.12.14-runCorHMM.R - runs the corhmm models 

20.12.15-analyzeCorHMM.R - preliminary analysis of corhmm models 

21.02.05-runSimmapsOUwie.R - generates simmaps proportional to the model averages of corHMM modeling. then runs the OU models on 1000 generated simmaps for each dataset (prec and temp with and without SE).

21.02.01-analyzeOUwie.R - model averages the tips so that we can values associated with abiotic and biotic parameters. produces preliminary figures.

21.02.03-reconCorHMM.R - model averages the corhmm fits and then does an ancestral state reconstruction. this is the same model averaged corhmm rate matrix used to generate simmaps.

SummaryTable_corHMM.xslx - a one stop shop to navigate through the results saved in table_corhmm/
